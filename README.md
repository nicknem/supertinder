## What it is

SuperTinder automatically 'right-swipe's girls on Tinder and records their details in an SQLite database as it does it.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/benbristow/supertinder
bundle install
ruby tinder.rb
```

* Acquire your Facebook ID and Auth Token using a web debugger like Fiddler or Charles. There's a few guides online on how to do this.

* Recommended that you run this in a tmux/screen session but that's optional.
