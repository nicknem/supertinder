#Motivation

Should I really explain the motivations behind this project?

#Installation

The code is probably broken now, I can't fix it because I have a girlfriend. But you get the logic. Just download Charles Proxy, sniff the secret Tinder API and start swiping.

Thanks to Sebastian Stadil for providing the guidelines and the basic logic, I can always count on you!
