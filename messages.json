["Bonjour ! I enjoyed your profile and think we might get along. Want to meet over coffee some time next week?",

"If you like pastries, I know a good place downtown that has lemon puffs, chocolate pies, fruit tarts, and macaroons!",

"Fine, if you don't like coffee nor pastries, we can do tea. How does tea sound?",

"Yeah, you are right. Tea is a little boring. We should get ice cream! How about the Bi-Rite Creamery?",

"I agree, ice cream is too clich√©. We should do something no one else does on a first date, like meet at a gas station and get beef jerky! Think of the stories we could tell our grandkids!",

"Alright, I'll admit that meeting at a gas station isn't the most romantic. And let's be honest: American food portions are so large we don't need more calories. How about a boat ride on Stow Lake? We can get a nice pedal boat and get fresh air and plenty of exercise. How about that?",

"I see you don't want to cultivate the body; how about we cultivate the mind instead? There's a Long Now foundation talk coming up, and the Castro Theatre regularly has intellectual cinema classics. How about going to one of those?",

"If San Francisco didn't have so much to offer, I'd be running out of ideas by now! Fortunately it is not so. Have you ever been to the opera? If not, you should! And I'll take you there!"]
